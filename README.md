# Wrong Words OSS

# Scope

I finally sat down and read [this](https://twitter.com/JessTelford/status/992756386160234497?s=20) twitter thread. There is/were a ton of nuggets of amazing vim/writing tricks in it. I wanted a place to start capturing the wrong words and have `vim` highlight them for me. This is my version of it.

**NOTE**: If you have suggestions to add to this, please don't hesitate to PR them in!

# Usage

1. Confirm you have a `.vim/plugins/` directory or the like.
2. Clone or copy the `wrong-words-oss.vim` into that directory.
3. This should start highlighting the words in your `.md`, `.txt`, `.rst` files when you exit `insert` mode.
